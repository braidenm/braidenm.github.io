<h1>What I hope to achieve at Skills Distillery</h1>

<a href="https://braidenm.github.io/">Home Page</a>

<p>Up until this point in my life I have been just going with the flow.
  If opportunity knocks I may answer, but there hasn’t been any real risk taking
  into the unknown. Taking on a completely new skillset in pursuit of something
  more meaningful, satisfying, or in line with my goals is going to be
  challenging. There will be many times I know I will want to give up and just
  go back to what I was doing, what I know. The risk is great, I stepped down
  from my current job, took out loans, and am risking everything for the chance
  to achieve a greater life for myself. This leap into the fog offers no path
  back, because there is a reason I am diverting from that path and would be
  forcing myself to look in new directions. This course at Skills Distillery
  will guide me through a whole new world of opportunities. Pushing me outside
  of my comfort zone and provide me with knowledge to sharpen my skills and be
  more independent of the retail rat race I was once apart of. For me, this is
  breaking the norm, spreading my wings, and leaving the nest of the known.
  After climbing the first ladder I came across, I now see there are other
  ladders  with better futures across the way, just need the courage to climb
  down and start a new.</p>

<P>I see myself learning the the skills necessary to become competitive in a
  world ever growing with technology. I see opportunity for better software
  every turn I make. From less glitchy point of sale machines, to more intuitive
  websites, to something new that hasn’t been done yet. As the world gets more
  connected with tech, I know that is where I need to go to secure a successful
  future for myself. I enjoy fixing things, when something doesn’t work
  correctly I love the challenge to fix it with the satisfaction of it working
  afterwards. Until this program I would have no idea where to start with
  glitchy apps or a new idea for an app. I know hard work, dedication, and study
  outside the classroom will get me to a competitive spot to secure a new and
  successful career.</p>

<p>I come from the retail world, working as a store manager at a major Seattle
  coffee chain for 5 years. I have achieved a number of accomplishments and
  unique experiences, I was well on my way to become a district manager. I then
  quit. In retail you are managing people for close to minimum wage and
  demanding they do an almost impossible amount of work. Every new thing
  corporate would come up with, would require more man hours yet they would cut
  hours instead. This makes for a bad environment and long stressful hours with
  no extra pay (salary.) To continue down that path hoping to make it into
  corporate, seemed the only way to escape. I had a moment where I realized I
  should be doing something more inline with what I love to do. So I went to
  work at a major outdoor supply retailer, to not only change environments but
  meet people to do the things I wanted to learn. After 2 years as a manager
  there ,I have been on some amazing adventures that I would have never done on
  my own. However, it is still retail and just more of the same. This company
  was not nearly as bad as the previous, but was still just retail. Had I really
  made a change? No, I was still just at the whim of an uncertain retail
  environment. Talks of everything going online, brick and mortar is fazing out,
  tech is the big thing. So here I am.</p>

<p>Bottom line, with this new skillset I am embracing, I hope to achieve
  financial stability to pursue my passions, flexibility to work wherever I
  want, and the time to enjoy those things. I believe a job in the tech industry
  will get me there. I have a degree in business management, many years of
  successful management experience, and now I will have the skills of a
  developer. With all of that I am confident I will find my place in the world
  of technology.</p>
