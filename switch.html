  <h1>The Difference Between switch and if/else in Java</h1>

  <p>Based on my current knowledge of java I am going to explain the difference
    between using switch and if/else statements. </p>

<p>To begin, when would we need to use these types of statements? Lets say you
would like a user to input a value of some kind. Whether it is a string or
integer, doesnâ€™t matter. You were also to provide what would appear next after
the user (whether computer or human) makes their entry. </p>

<p>An if/else example: you ask them to solve a problem, whether guessing a value
or solving a math problem. You would use a if/ else statement. This is what the
code would look like:</P>
