  <h1>The Difference Between switch and if/else in Java</h1>

  <p>Based on my current knowledge of java I am going to explain the difference
    between using switch and if/else statements.
  </p>

    <p>To begin, when would we need to use these types of statements? Lets say you
      would like a user to input a value of some kind. Whether it is a string or
      integer, doesn’t matter. You were also to provide what would appear next after
      the user (whether computer or human) makes their entry.
    </p>

    <p>An if/else example: you ask them to solve a problem, whether guessing a value
        or solving a math problem. You would use a if/ else statement. This is what the
        code would look like:
    </P>
    <p></p>

    <p></p>
    <p>An example of a switch: this is when you have a bigger list of things to
    choose from. Start off with a “switch (variable) {“ filled by a series of
    “case variable:”.  The code will keep running through every case until
    it hits a “break;” you should put the break at the end of every case unless
    you want it to run multiple cases. Using “default:” will run a message if
    the user puts in a variable you haven’t identified. This is what the code
    looks like:
    </p>
    <p></p>

    <p></p>

    <p>This is basically the gist of it. Both can be used much more in depth by
      nesting them or combining statements. I will save that discussion for a
      different topic.
    </P>
