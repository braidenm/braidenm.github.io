  <h1>When I Get Frustrated</h1>
  <a href="index.html">Home Page</a>

<p>Frustrations have a degree of severity; as such, so does the solutions.
  I am aware the coding bootcamp I am starting is going to be hard no doubt.
  I signed up knowing full well that I will struggle and push through it.
  This is how I deal with my frustrations:</p>

<ol>

  <li>Minor frustration: this could be cause by getting something wrong multiple
    times. I would take a breath and look at the elements one at a time.
    Breathing is good for you!<li>

<li>General frustration: not getting multiple things or falling behind. First
  off breath, then stop, see if there is a way to work on something else or
  take notes on what to look up later. Having a plan is a sure way to re-gain
  composure.</li>

<li>Super frustration: Okay, the world in imploding. Still breath, always
  important. Step away from the task if possible and go on a short walk. I am
  probably hungry is the most likely cause, this would be a point where I would
  eat a snack and go back to the project. Removing myself, calming down, then
  looking at the problem in new light is a sure way to get past something. note:
  this process might need to be repeated throughout the frustrating thing.</li>

</ol>
<p>Generally, getting enough sleep and food are first. After that, taking time
  to do something I enjoy or having a “zero” day really helps keep things in
  order to not reach the highest level of frustration.</p>
